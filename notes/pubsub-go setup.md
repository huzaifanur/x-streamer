For interacting with Google Cloud Pub/Sub in Go, you should use the official Cloud Client Libraries provided by Google. These libraries offer idiomatic, and easy-to-use client libraries for various Google Cloud services, including Pub/Sub.
To get started with the Go client library for Pub/Sub, you can follow these steps:
- Install the client library for Go using the following command:

go get -u cloud.google.com/go/pubsub

- Set up authentication by creating a service account with the necessary permissions and downloading a JSON key file. Then, set the environment variable GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS to the path of the JSON key file.
- Use the client library in your Go application to interact with Pub/Sub. You can publish messages to a topic or subscribe to a topic to receive messages.
Here's a simple example of how to publish a message to a topic using the Go client library:

package main

import (
	"context"
	"log"

	"cloud.google.com/go/pubsub"
)

func main() {
	ctx := context.Background()
	client, err := pubsub.NewClient(ctx, "your-project-id")
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to create client: %v", err)
	}

	topic := client.Topic("your-topic-id")
	defer topic.Stop()

	result := topic.Publish(ctx, &pubsub.Message{
		Data: []byte("Hello, world!"),
	})

	// Block until the result is returned and a server-generated
	// ID is returned for the published message.
	id, err := result.Get(ctx)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("Failed to publish: %v", err)
	}
	log.Printf("Published a message; msg ID: %v\n", id)
}

Remember to replace "your-project-id" and "your-topic-id" with your actual Google Cloud project ID and Pub/Sub topic ID.
For more detailed information and best practices, you can refer to the Pub/Sub client libraries documentation and the guide on publishing and receiving messages. These resources will provide you with comprehensive instructions and examples to effectively use the client library in your Go applications.
